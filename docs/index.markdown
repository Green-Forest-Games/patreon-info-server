**Patreon Info** is an third-party integration of the Patreon API for Unreal Engine 4. It allows you to add patron-exclusive features to your UE4 projects.

In addition to a UE4 plugin, Patreon Info also **requires** you to have a web server capable of processing PHP files, keep this in mind before purchasing the plugin.
